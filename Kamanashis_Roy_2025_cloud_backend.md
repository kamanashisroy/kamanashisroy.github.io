**SOFTWARE ENGINEER**

I gained over **15+ years** of experience in design and development ranging from scalable,distributed (call/text/video) web(JSON,**gRPC**) or ASN.1(L2,L3) based communication server (Linux C/C++) in a modular testable way. The layering of protocol stack, state-pattern, visitor-pattern, **code generation (** refer to [swig](https://github.com/kamanashisroy/swig) meta-data and [aroop](https://github.com/kamanashisroy/aroop) compiler backend**),** functional-patterns, asynchronous-patterns, multi-tasking, unique-ptr, shared-ptr and reactor-patterns are part of my expertise**.** 

Provided that I have backend professional experience, I am not afraid of writing Javascript, C\#,Python,Lua(as extension of C backend) for frontend or simulator purposes.

Last year I did a data-science course in UW that covered basic math and tools like **sci-kit** learning. This year 2025, I took part in the geometric [topcoder marathon challenge 60](https://github.com/kamanashisroy/topcoder_challenge_slime_harvester) which reflects the TCP/SCTP window sawtooth optimization and congestion control where I did some parameter tuning in the algorithm. Also please refer to my [dpdk journey](https://github.com/kamanashisroy/reactdpdk) for low-level(L1..L4) data-transmission optimization.

Language and framework: **C++14,Go**, Python, Lua  
**Code generation: Python, C++ template**  
Config and Unit testing: Yang,Yaml,XML,JSON,Whitebox testing,Satic Analyzer,Sanitizer,Valgrind,Code-coverage  
Continuous integration:Jenkins,Kubernetes,k8s, Docker, Helm Chart, Python  
Debugging: Wireshark, TCMalloc, Command interface to test memory usage and health, Postmortem analysis using **GDB scripts,** KPI analysis,Kafka  
**Tools:** Jira,Jenkins,gcc,gdb,git,Linux,Vim,Klocwork,Sanitizer

Achievements:

* **Automated network addressing** in distributed radio network cloud with **mobility** while avoiding network loop  
* Decoupled L3/L4 into container/cloud architecture along with **gRpc Services.**  
* Used persistent interface **Protobuf** between components to allow change while develop/deployment.  
  * Optimizing network via encapsulation and packaging  
* Convert legacy C code to RAII based C++ code **for increased stability and extensibility .**  
  * Used **compile time C++ parameter validation.**  
  * Forcing  abstraction **API** for **increased consistency and reliability**.   
  * Avoid memory corruption, buffer overflow, pointer-invalidation by using **C++ span and lambda** .  
* Capture **runtime events** for debugging or **AI analysis/telemetry**.

**WebRTC RESTFul Backend** 

Develop and maintain web based **Voice/Video/Screen-share/Text service stack signaling+media** (like video,audio,text) **gateway-server** for protocols like **SIP,SDP,RTP,RTCP,MSRP,WebRTC,oAuth** in distributed, scalable, virtualized setup (refer to my cool [python tool](https://github.com/kamanashisroy/opus_stream_tool) for **OPUS, H264** rtp debug/record ). 

***Achievements:***

* Deployed **hash-based static load balancing to ensure mutual exclusion in thread level**  
* Reduced memory+timer leak and crash by **using unique-pointer and RAII**  
* **Analysed/debugged SIP audio call flow end-to-end and visualized audio quality using gstreamer.**

**Technologies:** **C++14**, Python, **JSON, REST**, **WebRTC, SIP, SDP, HTTP, DTLS, Websocket, Message Queue, Event-loop,Protobuf,nginx,microservice**,**gStreamer**

Provides embedded-software services for the locomotive industry.

**Senior software engineer**  
As a scrum-team member designed, developed and tested **safety-critical** locomotive control protocol features for **automated driving**(I-ETMS) and PTC(positive train control). Emit error-code based on input or state and supervise based on decision-tree model based on **Physics equation and geo-location**.

***Achievements:***

* Reduced the maintenance cost by generating code from **csv metadata**(please refer to [swig](https://github.com/kamanashisroy/swig)).  
* Maintained Visual C\# (CMake) based **managed** driving simulator with C++/QNX application.   
* Provided static lookup-optimization of design by using hash-code of metadata.  
* Reduced the bottleneck of nightly-build time by providing parallel-build enhancements that saves **three hours** for each individual developer.  
* Optimized message-queue for OS Performance.
